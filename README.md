# Empty Shelf Detection

A small flask app where we can upload and image and get result for empty shelf detection using a YOLOv5 model.

## Steps for running

First we need to install the required libraries for using the YOLO model. For this, simply run:

```
pip3 install -r yolov5/requirements.txt
```

Now we can run the server where the application will be hosted.

```
python3 main.py
```
